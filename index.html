      <div class="desc-review">Hi all,
        Bangalore is a city with Excellent weather, Nice greenery, Tall Trees, and Hill station like Roads, ups & downs. Dislike the rude Police, too many religious places in the busy public places,
        I like Bangalore very much as the people are friendly lot and corperative. It has a lot of attractions but unfortunately. The food is good and the climate is pleasant.
        
        Just love to be here. Beautiful roads, too friendly people, must visit.
        
        Love you Bangalore

      <div class="desc-review">The Taj Mahal in Agra is widely considered as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, and attracts millions of visitors each year. The white marble mausoleum was built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife Mumtaz Mahal. The intricate carvings and inlaid precious stones in the building are remarkable and visitors are often left in awe of its beauty and grandeur. The surrounding gardens, fountains and reflecting pool also add to the serene and peaceful atmosphere. Despite the large crowds, it is definitely worth a visit to experience the stunning architecture and rich history of the Taj Mahal</div>

<div class="desc-review">Delhi, the capital city of India, has seen significant transformations in recent years, and its present scenario is a complex blend of tradition and modernity. In this 500-word overview, I will touch upon various aspects of Delhi's current state, encompassing its culture, economy, infrastructure, environment, and social dynamics.

   The economic landscape of Delhi has undergone remarkable changes. It is one of the largest commercial and financial hubs in India. The city hosts a diverse range of industries, including information technology, manufacturing, retail, and services. The expansion of metro networks, improved connectivity, and the presence of numerous business districts like Connaught Place and Cyber Hub have further fueled economic growth.
